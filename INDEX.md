## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Mock Authentication
The application uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DISABLED=true` to enable mock authentication. This means:
- Any email/password combination is accepted
- Automatic JWT token generation
- No dependency on real Auth service for testing
- Perfect for development and testing

See [MOCK_AUTH_FIXED.md](MOCK_AUTH_FIXED.md) for technical details.

### Microservices Architecture
- **Gateway**: API BFF (Backend for Frontend)
- **Auth Service**: User and role management
- **CRM Service**: Core business logic (deals, clients, payments)
- **Notifications**: Real-time updates via SSE
- **Tasks**: Task management and tracking
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Consul

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for architecture details.

### Docker Orchestration
All services run in Docker containers orchestrated by docker-compose with health checks and service dependencies properly configured.

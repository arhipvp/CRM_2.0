## üîß How to Fix

### Step 1: Restart Docker Desktop (Windows)

**Method A: Using System Tray**
1. Click Docker icon in system tray (bottom right)
2. Click "Restart Docker Desktop"
3. Wait for Docker to restart (2-3 minutes)

**Method B: Using Task Manager**
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Search for "Docker Desktop"
3. Click it and select "End Task"
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Open Docker Desktop again from Start menu
6. Wait for it to fully start

**Method C: Using PowerShell**
```powershell
# Stop Docker service
taskkill /IM "Docker Desktop.exe" /F

# Wait 5 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# Restart Docker (it may auto-start, or manually open Docker Desktop)
```

### Step 2: Verify Docker is Working
```bash
docker --version
docker ps
```

Both commands should work without errors.

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend Container
```bash
cd "C:\Dev\CRM_2.0\infra"

# Deploy with fresh build
docker-compose --env-file ../.env --profile backend --profile app up -d --force-recreate frontend
```

### Step 4: Verify Frontend is Running
```bash
# Check container
docker ps | grep frontend

# Check logs
docker logs -f crm-frontend
```

### Step 5: Access Application
Open browser: http://localhost:3000

## ‚úÖ What to Expect After Restart

### Frontend Status
- Container will be created from the newly built image
- Image: `crm-frontend:latest`
- Port: 3000
- Status: Should be "Healthy" after ~5-10 seconds

### First Access
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- You should see the login page
- Login with any email and password
- Redirect to dashboard

### Build Confirmation
The build was successful before Docker issues, so you should see:
- All routes compiled
- Dashboard loading
- Deals, clients, payments, etc. accessible

## üéØ Complete Recovery Steps

```bash
# 1. Restart Docker Desktop (manual or via methods above)
# Wait 2-3 minutes for Docker to start

# 2. Verify Docker is running
docker ps

# 3. Navigate to infra
cd "C:\Dev\CRM_2.0\infra"

# 4. Deploy frontend with new image
docker-compose --env-file ../.env --profile backend --profile app up -d --force-recreate frontend

# 5. Wait 5-10 seconds for container to start
sleep 10

# 6. Check status
docker ps | grep frontend

# 7. Check logs for successful startup
docker logs crm-frontend | tail -20

# 8. Open browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

## üÜò If It Still Doesn't Work

### Option A: Full Docker Reset
```powershell
# WARNING: This will delete all images and containers

# Stop Docker
taskkill /IM "Docker Desktop.exe" /F

# Remove Docker data (from Docker Desktop settings)
# Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí RESET

# Restart Docker Desktop
```

### Option B: Check Docker Desktop Logs
```
Docker Desktop ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Troubleshoot ‚Üí View logs
Look for error messages
Report issues to Docker
```

### Option C: Full System Restart
Sometimes a full Windows restart helps:
```powershell
Restart-Computer
```

Then repeat the deployment steps above.

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Build Symlink Issue on Windows**:
   - The `pnpm build` command has symlink issues on Windows with WSL
   - Solution: Run build in a Linux environment or Docker container
   - Dev server (`pnpm dev`) works without issues

2. **API Client Test Failures**:
   - Some API client tests need fetch mock setup
   - Unit tests for API functions can be improved
   - Component tests work correctly

3. **No Real Authentication**:
   - Uses mock authentication in demo mode
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DISABLED=true` for demo
   - Production requires real auth integration

### Planned Enhancements (v1.1)

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Deal pipeline analytics
   - Revenue forecasting
   - Team performance metrics

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - Bulk deal updates
   - Bulk export/import
   - Bulk email/notification sending

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Live cursor position in shared deals
   - Real-time note updates
   - Presence indicators

4. **Custom Fields**
   - User-defined deal fields
   - Custom client attributes
   - Dynamic form generation

5. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Saved filter templates
   - Complex filter conditions
   - Filter sharing among team

6. **Automation**
   - Workflow automation rules

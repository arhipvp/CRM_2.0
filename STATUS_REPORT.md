## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue: Documents Service Restarting
- **Status**: ⚠️ Non-critical
- **Cause**: BullMQ queue configuration invalid (`:` in name)
- **Impact**: Does NOT affect frontend or core CRM functionality
- **Workaround**: Service not needed for dev/test of main features
- **Fix**: Update queue configuration in backend/documents/src/

### Issue: Nginx Gateway Dependency (FIXED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Was**: Nginx depending on undefined gateway service
- **Now**: Nginx depends only on frontend service
- **Verification**: `docker-compose config | grep -A 3 "nginx:"`

### Issue: Port 3000 in Use (FIXED)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Was**: Previous development server occupying port
- **Now**: Port freed and frontend running
- **Verification**: `curl http://localhost:3000`

## 🎓 Key Learnings Documented

### Next.js Build-Time Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables embedded during Docker build
- Must be in Dockerfile as ARG (builder) and ENV
- Must be passed via docker-compose build args
- Must be in .env file

### Docker Multi-Stage Builds
- Builder stage: compilation, optimization
- Runner stage: only artifacts needed
- Both stages can use same ARG/ENV declarations

### Git Repository Safety
- Deleted directories can be restored via git checkout
- Commit history maintained across deletions
- Provides safety net for accidental changes

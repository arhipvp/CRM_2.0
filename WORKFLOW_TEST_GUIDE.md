cd infra && docker-compose restart frontend

# Wait 30 seconds for health check
sleep 30

- React router handles navigation client-side
- Browser DevTools → Network tab shows 200 responses

### Issue: "Logout doesn't work"

**Solution**:
- Check auth store is properly initialized
- Clear browser cookies: DevTools → Storage → Cookies
- Reload page
- Try logout again

### Issue: "Mock data not showing"

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors: DevTools → Console
- Verify React Query is loading: DevTools → Network
- Check API client is using fallback
- Look for error boundaries

### Issue: "Forms don't submit"

**Solution**:

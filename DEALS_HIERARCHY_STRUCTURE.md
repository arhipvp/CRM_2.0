**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Commit:** `ab6ca3b`

## Overview

The Deals tab has been refactored to display a hierarchical tree structure that represents the actual business relationships:

```
Deal
├── 📋 Policies
│   ├── Policy #1 (Status, Premium)
│   ├── Policy #2 (Status, Premium)
│   └── ...
├── 📊 Calculations
│   ├── Calculation #1 (Insurance Company, Amount)
│   ├── Calculation #2 (Insurance Company, Amount)
│   └── ...
└── 💰 Payments
    ├── Payment #1 (Date, Amount, Status)
    ├── Payment #2 (Date, Amount, Status)
    └── ...
```

---

## Key Features

### 1. Hierarchical Tree View
- Each **Deal** is a root node
- Deal information displayed: Title | Status | Amount
- Three collapsible sections for each deal: Policies, Calculations, Payments
- Visual indicators with emojis for easy identification

### 2. Lazy Loading
- Child data only loads when deal node is expanded
- Reduces initial load time
- Placeholders (`...`) shown until data loads
- Efficient API usage - only fetch data when needed

### 3. Visual Organization
- **📋 Policies** section:
  - Shows count: `📋 Policies (5)`
  - Each policy: `Policy Number | Status: [status] | Premium: [amount]`

- **📊 Calculations** section:
  - Shows count: `📊 Calculations (3)`
  - Each calculation: `Insurance Company | Amount`

- **💰 Payments** section:
  - Shows count: `💰 Payments (12)`
  - Each payment: `Date | Amount | Status`

### 4. Smart Selection Validation
- Only Deal nodes can be edited/deleted (not child items)
- Warning if user tries to edit child item
- Double-click on Deal opens detail dialog
- Double-click on child items has no effect

### 5. Data Operations

**Add Deal**
- Opens DealEditDialog
- Creates new deal via API
- Refreshes tree

**Edit Deal**
- Select deal (not child) → Click Edit
- Fetches current deal data
- Opens DealEditDialog with existing data
- Updates via API

**Delete Deal**
- Select deal (not child) → Click Delete
- Confirmation dialog
- Deletes via API
- Refreshes tree

**Refresh**
- Reloads all deals
- Collapses all expanded nodes

**Export CSV/Excel**
- Exports flat list of deals (not hierarchical)
- Useful for spreadsheets
- Includes: ID, Title, Client, Status, Amount, Deleted

## Data Flow

### Initial Load
```
1. refresh_tree() called
2. Background thread:
   - Fetch all deals
   - Fetch all clients
3. Update UI with deal list
4. Show placeholders for child sections
5. Bind expand event
```

### On Expand (User clicks ▶)
```
1. <<TreeviewOpen>> event triggered
2. Check if deal node (3 placeholder children)
3. If yes, load_deal_children():
   - Background thread:
     * Fetch policies (all)
     * Fetch calculations (for this deal)
     * Fetch payments (for this deal)
4. populate_deal_children():
   - Remove placeholders
   - Add actual data as child nodes
```

### On Search/Filter
```
1. _on_search_change() called
2. Filter all_deals by title/status
3. Refresh tree display with filtered deals
4. Collapses all nodes (clean state)
```

## Code Structure

### Key Methods

**`_refresh_tree_display(deals_to_display)`**
- Clears tree
- For each deal:
  - Create deal node with info
  - Add 3 placeholder children (policies, calculations, payments)
- Bind expand event

**`_on_expand_node(event)`**
- Check if deal node (3 children with "...")
- If not already loaded, call `_load_deal_children()`

**`_load_deal_children(deal_id)`**
- Background thread
- Fetch policies, calculations, payments
- Call `_populate_deal_children()` on main thread

**`_populate_deal_children(deal_id, policies, calculations, payments)`**
- Get deal node from tree
- Clear placeholder children
- Create sections with actual data
- Add items to sections

---

## Example Usage

### User Expands a Deal

1. **Initial state:**
   ```
   Deal: Acme Corp Project | Status: active | Amount: 100000
   ├── 📋 Policies...
   ├── 📊 Calculations...
   └── 💰 Payments...
   ```

2. **User clicks ▶ to expand**
   - `<<TreeviewOpen>>` event fires
   - `_on_expand_node()` detects deal node
   - `_load_deal_children()` fetches data

3. **Data loaded from API:**
   ```
   Deal: Acme Corp Project | Status: active | Amount: 100000
   ├── 📋 Policies (2)
   │   ├── Policy001 | Status: active | Premium: 5000
   │   └── Policy002 | Status: pending | Premium: 3000
   ├── 📊 Calculations (1)
   │   └── Insurance Co | 7500
   └── 💰 Payments (3)
       ├── 2025-01-15 | 5000 | completed
       ├── 2025-02-20 | 3000 | completed
       └── 2025-03-15 | 2500 | pending
   ```

### User Edits a Deal

1. Select deal (click on deal line)
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Validates it's a deal (not child node)
4. Fetches current deal data
5. Opens DealEditDialog
6. User modifies fields
7. Saves → API update
8. Tree refreshes

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

All UI strings are localized to Russian:
- `i18n("Policies")` → "Полисы"
- `i18n("Calculations")` → "Расчеты"
- `i18n("Payments")` → "Платежи"
- `i18n("Status")` → "Статус"
- `i18n("Premium")` → "Премия"
- `i18n("Add Deal")` → "Добавить сделку"

---

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading Benefits
- **Initial load:** Only deals loaded (~50-100ms)
- **On expand:** Only that deal's children loaded (~200-500ms)
- **Total:** Faster perceived load time

### API Calls
```
Startup:
- get_deals() × 1
- get_clients() × 1

Per expand:
- get_policies() × 1 (once)
- get_calculations(deal_id) × 1 (once per deal)
- get_payments(deal_id) × 1 (once per deal)

Refresh:
- get_deals() × 1
- get_clients() × 1
- (all expanded deals re-collapse)
```

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Policies shown are ALL policies (not filtered to deal)
   - API doesn't support deal-specific policy filtering
   - Could add client-side filtering if needed

2. No income/expenses tracking
   - Future: Add 4th section for financial transactions
   - Would show income vs. expenses breakdown

3. Export is flat (not hierarchical)
   - By design for spreadsheet compatibility
   - Hierarchical export could be added if needed

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Financial Dashboard:**
   - Add income/expenses section
   - Show total deal profitability
   - Track financial status

2. **Context Menus:**
   - Right-click on deal → "View Details", "Edit", "Delete"
   - Right-click on policy → "View Full Details"
   - Right-click on calculation → "Edit Calculation"

3. **Drag & Drop:**
   - Move policies between deals
   - Reorganize sections

4. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - Filter by policy status
   - Filter by payment status
   - Date range filtering

5. **Color Coding:**
   - Red for overdue payments
   - Green for completed payments
   - Yellow for pending items

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Expand deal - loads policies, calculations, payments
- [ ] Collapse deal - keeps data (doesn't reload)
- [ ] Add new deal - appears in tree
- [ ] Edit deal - updates in tree
- [ ] Delete deal - removed from tree
- [ ] Search filter - filters deals properly
- [ ] Export CSV/Excel - includes all deals
- [ ] Double-click deal - opens detail dialog
- [ ] Double-click child item - no effect (safe)
- [ ] Edit/delete child item - shows warning
- [ ] Right-click - selects item (logging works)

---

## Summary

The Deals tab now provides a **hierarchical view** that accurately reflects the business model:

```
A Deal
├─ contains multiple Policies
├─ has multiple Calculations (insurance quotes)
└─ tracks multiple Payments
```

This makes it clear to users how these entities relate to each other, improving understanding and usability of the CRM system.

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTING AND USE**

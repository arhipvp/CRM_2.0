**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Commit:** `fc7af75`

---

## Overview

The DealDetailDialog has been fully implemented with comprehensive functionality for managing all deal-related entities: Policies, Calculations, and Payments, along with financial tracking.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Policies Management Tab

**Display:**
- Table view showing all policies
- Columns: Policy Number, Status, Premium, Effective From, Effective To
- Asynchronously loaded when dialog opens

**Functionality:**
- **Add Policy**: Opens PolicyEditDialog
  - User selects client and deal (pre-selected)
  - Fills in policy number, status, premium, dates
  - Creates policy via API
  - Automatically reloads policies table

- **Delete Policy**: Select row and click Delete
  - Confirmation dialog
  - Soft delete (is_deleted flag)
  - Reloads table on success

**Code Flow:**
```
User clicks "Add" button
  ↓
PolicyEditDialog(parent, crm_service, clients_list=self.all_clients)
  ↓
User fills form → clicks OK
  ↓
Worker thread: crm_service.create_policy(**dialog.result)
  ↓
Success → messagebox.showinfo()
  ↓
_reload_policies() → _update_policies_tree()
  ↓
Table refreshed with new policy
```

**Data Structures:**
```python
# Loaded from API
policies = [
    {
        "id": "uuid-123",
        "policy_number": "POL001",
        "status": "active",
        "premium": 5000.00,
        "effective_from": "2025-01-01",
        "effective_to": "2026-01-01",
        "client_id": "client-uuid",
        "deal_id": "deal-uuid",
        ...
    },
    ...
]

# Mapping for UI operations
policy_id_map = {
    "tree_item_id_1": "uuid-123",
    "tree_item_id_2": "uuid-456",
    ...
}
```

### 2. Calculations Management Tab

**Display:**
- Table view of deal-specific calculations
- Columns: Insurance Company, Program Name, Premium Amount, Coverage Sum
- Deal-filtered data

**Functionality:**
- **Add Calculation**: Opens CalculationEditDialog
  - Deal is pre-selected (read-only)
  - User fills: company, program name, amounts, dates
  - Creates calculation via API
  - Reloads table

- **Delete Calculation**: Select and delete
  - Soft delete via API
  - Reloads calculations

**Data Structures:**
```python
calculations = [
    {
        "id": "calc-uuid",
        "deal_id": "deal-uuid",
        "insurance_company": "Insure Corp A",
        "program_name": "Health Plan",
        "premium_amount": 7500.00,
        "coverage_sum": 100000.00,
        "calculation_date": "2025-10-24",
        "status": "draft",
        "comments": "...",
        ...
    },
    ...
]

calculation_id_map = {
    "tree_item_1": "calc-uuid",
    ...
}
```

### 3. Payments Management Tab

**Display:**
- Table view of deal-specific payments
- Columns: Date, Amount, Status, Planned Amount
- Shows actual date or planned date

**Functionality:**
- **Add Payment**: Opens PaymentEditDialog
  - Deal and policy pre-selected
  - User fills: amount, currency, dates, status, comment
  - Creates payment via API
  - Reloads payments AND updates financial summary

- **Delete Payment**: Select and delete
  - Hard delete via API
  - Reloads and updates finances

**Key Features:**
- Payments link deals to policies
- Each payment tracks:
  - Planned vs. Actual amounts
  - Status (scheduled, completed, failed, cancelled)
  - Incomes/expenses totals
  - Related transactions

**Data Structures:**
```python
payments = [
    {
        "id": "payment-uuid",
        "deal_id": "deal-uuid",
        "policy_id": "policy-uuid",
        "sequence": 1,
        "status": "completed",
        "planned_date": "2025-01-15",
        "actual_date": "2025-01-15",
        "planned_amount": 5000.00,
        "currency": "RUB",
        "comment": "...",
        "incomes_total": 5000.00,
        "expenses_total": 0.00,
        "net_total": 5000.00,
        ...
    },
    ...
]

payment_id_map = {
    "tree_item_1": "payment-uuid",
    ...
}
```

### 4. Income/Expenses Tab (Financial Summary)

**Display:**
- Dynamic financial summary
- Three key metrics:
  - Total Income: Sum of all `incomes_total` from payments
  - Total Expenses: Sum of all `expenses_total` from payments
  - Net: Income - Expenses

**Calculation:**
```python
total_income = sum(float(p.get("incomes_total", 0) or 0) for p in self.payments)
total_expenses = sum(float(p.get("expenses_total", 0) or 0) for p in self.payments)
net = total_income - total_expenses
```

**Example:**
```
Total Income:     450,000.00 RUB
Total Expenses:   120,000.00 RUB
Net:              330,000.00 RUB
```

**Updates:**
- Automatically recalculates when payments are added/deleted
- Called in `_reload_payments()` method
- Uses `_update_finances()` for recalculation

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety

All API operations use background threads to keep UI responsive:

```python
def _add_policy(self):
    dialog = PolicyEditDialog(...)
    if dialog.result:
        def worker():
            try:
                self.crm_service.create_policy(**dialog.result)
                self.after(0, lambda: messagebox.showinfo(...))
                self.after(0, self._reload_policies)
            except Exception as e:
                self.after(0, lambda: messagebox.showerror(...))

        from threading import Thread
        Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()
```

**Key Points:**
- All heavy operations in background thread
- `self.after(0, callback)` schedules UI updates on main thread
- Prevents UI freeze during network calls

### ID Mapping

Tkinter Treeview returns auto-generated item IDs that don't match API entity IDs.
Solution: Maintain maps for each entity type:

```python
self.policy_id_map = {}  # Maps treeview item_id → policy.id
self.calculation_id_map = {}  # Maps treeview item_id → calculation.id
self.payment_id_map = {}  # Maps treeview item_id → payment.id
```

When deleting:
```python
selected_tree_item = self.policies_tree.selection()[0]
actual_policy_id = self.policy_id_map[selected_tree_item]
self.crm_service.delete_policy(actual_policy_id)
```

### Data Reload Flow

After any add/delete operation:

```
1. _reload_policies()
   ↓
2. Worker thread: self.policies = self.crm_service.get_policies()
   ↓
3. Main thread: self._update_policies_tree()
   ↓
4. Clear tree, update maps, repopulate with fresh data
```

### Error Handling

Complete error handling at every step:

```python
try:
    # API call or data processing
    self.crm_service.create_policy(**dialog.result)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to create policy: {e}")
    messagebox.showerror(i18n("Error"), f"Failed to create policy: {str(e)}")
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
